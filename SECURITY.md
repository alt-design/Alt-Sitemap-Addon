# Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security very seriously at Alt Design. If you discover a potential security vulnerability in this project, please report it **privately** to us rather than opening a public issue.

### Contact

Please send all security reports to:

**Email:** ben@alt-design.net

Include as much detail as possible, such as:

- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Impact assessment
- Affected version(s)
- Any suggested mitigations (if known)

We will acknowledge receipt of your report promptly and keep you updated on progress.

### Response Time

We aim to respond within 48 hours. Critical vulnerabilities may receive priority handling.

### Public Disclosure

After a fix has been released and verified, we may publicly disclose the vulnerability in a security advisory. We will give credit to reporters unless they request anonymity.

### Security Updates

We publish security updates as new releases. We strongly recommend users upgrade to the latest version to stay protected.
